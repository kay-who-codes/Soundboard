# Soundboard App

A fun, interactive soundboard app that lets you play various sound effects at the click of a button. It offers a wide variety of sounds, from general noises to meme sound bites and gaming effects. You can also toggle between dark and light mode and use a mobile-friendly dropdown interface for easy access.
